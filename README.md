# Project Title : "SimpeeDine" An Intelligent Food Demand 
# Forecasting Management System in Restaurants 
According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) 75% of the food 
produced all around the world (only for human consumption) just over billion tons per year is 
wasted without consuming. At the same time, around the world about 900 million people are 
starving and suffering from malnutrition and hunger. (Bronte; 2021). 
One of the most important parts of maximizing revenue and also satisfying customers is the 
perfect amount of food. When demand is lower than production, assets and resources will be 
wasted, but when the demand is higher than the supply, there will be a lack of consumer 
satisfaction. 
This food wastage situation is a real-life challenge for resource optimization, which can be 
efficiently overcome by pattern recognition, and data mining techniques. Those demand 
forecasting systems are developed to forecast the future demand for a specific product or service. 
This is an end result of the project to build such a demand forecasting system. 
The proposed solution, SimpeeDine will be built by using the historical data of previous sales, 
promotions and discount data to get predictive output of the demand for a particular food item for 
the new coming week. The system SimpeeDine is mainly relied on regression and machine 
learning models that is trained and tested by applying a Voting Regressor. The Alogorythems which have been used for the proposed system are CatBoost Regression, LGBM Regression, Random Forest Regression, XGB 
Regression, Decision Tree Regression, AdaBoost Regression. After looking at the metrics findings, low error levels and a high performance rating, the Catboost algorithm took first prize. 
However, the algorithms employed in the majority of published work, Random Forest and 
Decision Tree, came in third and fifth, respectively. The Perdition results were then optimized and 
improved using the Voting Regressor. Several top-performing algorithms were used as estimators 
to test four voting regression models. The following estimators are employed in each voting 
regression model: Voting Regressor 01 - CatBoost Regression, LGBM Regression.  Voting Regressor 02 - CatBoost Regression, Random Forest Regression .Voting Regressor 03 - CatBoost Regression, LGBM Regression, Random Forest Regression. Voting Regressor 04 - CatBoost Regression, LGBM Regression, Random Forest Regression, XGB 
Regression.
